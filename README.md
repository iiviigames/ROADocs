# Rivals of Aether Workshop API

These is an unofficial implementation of the information found at the [Rivals of Aether](https://rivalsofaether.com/workshop) website.

Motivation
-----------

I like to have all the data I need for a project in a single, interlinked page and thus thought I'd simply create something just like that.


Frameworks?
----------

I'll be using either the [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) or the [daux](https://daux.io/) documentation generator  for this project. It will be hosted here on Github Pages. No promises on if I can complete it, but we'll see.
