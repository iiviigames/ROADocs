# Unofficial Rivals Workshop Documentation

![](banner.png)

[Rivals of Aether](https://store.steampowered.com/app/383980/Rivals_of_Aether/) is a fantastic _Super Smash Bros._ inspired game with frenetic combat, stunning pixel art, and a skill ceiling that is so high, my downstaris neigbors broom can't even get to it.

If new to the game, well, take some time to familiarize yourself with the characters that come in the base game, first - but, if you've played them all, and find yourself wishing that a **a character that could cancel all regulars into specials and all specials back to regulars, and is also a facehugger from the _Aliens_ series** could be in the game.

Now, **you can make that happen**.

[Dan Fornace](https://danfornace.com), along with the rest of the devs at Rivals HQ have opened up the shed, and given you access to all the tools in the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/383980/workshop/). 

This documentation aims to give you the tools needed to build any possible characters, buddies, stages, or abominations that your heart desires.
